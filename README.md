# 🛫 Airport Data Analysis – SQL Project

## 📚 Overview
This project analyzes airport-related data using SQL. It includes schema design, sample queries, and insights derived from a large dataset of airport attributes. The goal is to explore patterns in airport distribution, state-wise traffic, and carrier presence.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (DDL + DML)
- CSV (raw data)

## 🔍 Sample Queries
- 1.Count how often each route (origin → destination) appears.
- Most busiest airports
- longest flight routes
- Identify routes with the highest number of flights

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Open schema in MySQL Workbench and execute
3. Import `Airport_Project_Data.csv` into your database
4. Run queries from queries to explore insights
